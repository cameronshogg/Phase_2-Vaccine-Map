# Phase_2-Vaccine-Map

## Note: You need to download the HTML File to view the map.

Using geopandas and Pandas-Bokeh, as well as census data, created a map of the postal codes that were announced as Phase 2 "Hotspots" for targeted vaccination.

The statcan file was apparently too big to host on github - it can be downloaded from here:
https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-2016-eng.cfm 
and extracted.
